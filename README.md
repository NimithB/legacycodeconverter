# COBOL to Python Translator

This repository contains a tool for translating COBOL code to Python using a sequence-to-sequence deep learning model.

## Overview

The COBOL to Python Translator is a tool developed to assist programmers in converting COBOL code to Python automatically. It utilizes a deep learning model trained on a dataset of paired COBOL and Python code to perform the translation. The model architecture consists of an encoder-decoder framework with LSTM layers for sequence processing.

## Features

- **Automatic Translation**: Simply input your COBOL code, and the translator will generate the equivalent Python code.
- **Trained Model**: The translator employs a trained deep learning model to ensure accurate translations.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: With a simple function call, you can integrate the translator into your projects seamlessly.

## Usage

To use the COBOL to Python Translator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Python, TensorFlow, etc.).
3. Load the trained model and token index dictionary.
4. Call the translation function with your COBOL code as input.
5. Retrieve the translated Python code and use it as needed.
